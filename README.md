SUMMARY

A deep learning project utilizing CNNs for handwritten digit classification on the MNIST dataset, with deployment demonstrated via a web application.


OVERVIEW-HANDWRITTEN DIGIT CLASSIFICATION USING CNNs AND OCR

This project represents a foundational deep learning application that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten digits. The model is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset widely used in computer vision research.

Dataset Details:

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 labeled training images and 10,000 test images.

Each image is a grayscale representation of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

The dataset is publicly available through the official MNIST repository

Model Architecture:

CNNs are employed to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from the digit images.

The network captures edges, curves, and complex patterns, enabling highly accurate classification.

Deployment Demonstration:

To showcase practical usability, the trained model is integrated into a web application.

The web app allows users to input handwritten digits and receive real-time predictions, demonstrating the end-to-end workflow from model training to deployment.
